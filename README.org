#+title: Train Modeling in VRML

A project for VRML course at AGH UST.

The idea is to extend a given VRML model of a simple model railroad
provided (see: original/) in whatever interesting way the imagination
will tell to.


NOTE: Files in original/ were given to the class and were authored by
a PhD leading the class.
